# Introduction
There are some problems in searching Tailors and Stitching New Clothes. Like People new in City 
don’t know the nearby Tailors and also some busy ones don’t have much time to approach a tailor 
physically. So in PickNStitch I am going to develop a user friendly web platform that connects 
skilled online tailors with the customers through the rider at their doorsteps. Firstly, a customer 
after login, who wants to stitch his clothes will select a tailor from Nearby Tailors page which 
shows the integrated map and registered Tailors near your location on it. Then he will do chat with 
a specific tailor, after the chat & sizing the Tailor will post the delivery and a rider accept the 
delivery order and will do the delivery of clothes from customer to Tailor. After the complete 
stitching the Tailor again post a delivery request and a rider after accepting delivery request will 
deliver clothes from tailor to the user and payment will be Cash on Delivery. Tailors are also can 
post there new variety of clothes as a post and if some user want to buy this than he also able to 
place order and some rider after accepting will do delivery to him.
